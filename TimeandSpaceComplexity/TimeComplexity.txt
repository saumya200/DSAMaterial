-----> Three important points for time complexity(Big - O Notation) must and should every developer should remember are :
1. Always consider TC , in worst case scenario.
2. Avoid constants
3. Avoid lower values.

---------> Big - O Notation : Worst Case scenario [Upper Bound]
---------> Theta - Notation : Average Case scenario
----------> Omega - Notation : Best Case scenario [Lower Bound]


-----------> Space complexity:

Auxiliary space (space that you take to store the problem) + input space(the space that you take to store the input)

Eg : int a , b;

     int c  = a+b;

     a , b ----> input space
     c ------> auxiliary space (extra space taken in the memory and hence it is called auxiliary space)

     Here SC : O(3) ;
